                             input outdir side [side ...]

Split a TIFF image in smaller TIFF images of the specified side(s).

If two different sides are provided, the smaller images will be rectangular.
The first side corresponds to the X (columns) and the second to the Y (rows).
By default, only one side is required, which is used by the script for both X
and Y sides. In other words, square smaller images are produced.

If the original dimensions are not multiples of the specified side, a portion
of the image is lost, unless the --enlarge option is used. In that case, the
smaller images generated from the image border will contain empty pixels.

If the input image is a 3D stack, it will be split only on XY and the output
images will have the same number of slices. Using the --slice option, it is
possible to specify which slice to split (i.e., the output will be in 2D).
Defaults to first slice (--slice 0).

It is also possible to generate overlapping split images. This can be achieved
by using either the -S or -O options (which cannot be used together). With the
-S option, you can specify the step used when splitting the image, as a
fraction of its sides or as an absolute number of pixels. With the -O option,
you can specify the overlapping region between consecutive split images as a
fraction of their sides or as absolute pixels. In other words, the options
-S 0.9 and -O 0.1 yield the same result. It is possible to provide two values
to -S and -O, to obtain different overlaps in X and Y.

By default, split images are generated left-to-right, top-to-bottom, e.g.,
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Use the option -I to generate them top-to-bottom, left-to-right, e.g.,
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9

Examples:

- Square images of 100x100 px
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e

- Rectangular images of 125x100 px
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 125 -e

- Square images of 100x100 px, overlapping for 10 px in X and Y
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -S 0.9
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -S 90
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -O 0.1
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -O 10

- Square images of 100x100 px, overlapping for 10 px in X and 20 px in Y
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -S 0.9 0.8
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -S 90 80
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -O 0.1 0.2
tiff_split big_image.tif split_out_dir 100 -e -O 10 20

positional arguments:
  input                 Path to the TIFF image to split.
  outdir                Path to output TIFF folder, created if missing.
  side                  One or two (XY) sides, used to specify the smaller
                        images dimensions.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --step NUMBER [NUMBER ...]
                        Step for splitting, defined as a fraction of the
                        specified side(s).
  --overlap NUMBER [NUMBER ...]
                        Overlap fraction of splitted images, defined as a
                        fraction of the specified side(s).
  --slice NUMBER        ID of slice to be extracted from Z-stacks, 1-indexed.
  --enlarge             Expand to avoid pixel loss.
  --version             show program's version number and exit

advanced arguments:
  --invert              Split top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
  -y, --do-all          Do not ask for settings confirmation and proceed.
