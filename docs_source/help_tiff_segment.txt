                               input

Perform automatic 3D segmentation of TIFF images. The default parameters are
optimized for nuclear DNA staining and voxel size of 0.13x0.13x0.3 uM.

The input images are first identified based on a regular expression matched to
the file name. Then, they are re-scaled (if deconvolved with Huygens software).
Afterwards, a global (Otsu) and local (gaussian) thresholds are applied to
binarize the image in 3D. Finally, holes are filled in 3D and closed to remove
small objects. Finally. objects are filtered based on volume and Z size.
Moreover, objects touching the XY image borders are discarded.

If a folder path is provided with the -2 option, any binary file with name
matching the one of an input image will be combined to the binarized image.

Use the --labeled flag to label identified objects with different intensity
levels. By default, the script generates compressed binary tiff images; use the
--uncompressed flag to generate normal tiff images instead.

Input images that have the specified prefix and suffix are not segmented.

positional arguments:
  input                 Path single tiff image, or to folder containing
                        deconvolved tiff images.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o DIRPATH            Path to output TIFF folder. Defaults to the input
                        folder
  --outprefix TEXT      Prefix for output binarized images name. Default: ''.
  --outsuffix TEXT      Suffix for output binarized images name. Default:
                        'mask'.
  --neighbour NUMBER    Side of neighbourhood region for adaptig thresholding.
                        Must be odd. Default: 101
  --radius MIN_RADIUS MAX_RADIUS
                        Filter range of object radii [px]. Default: [10, Inf]
  --min-Z FRACTION      Minimum stack fraction occupied by an object. Default:
                        .25
  --mask-2d DIRPATH     Path to folder with 2D masks with matching name, to
                        combine with 3D masks.
  --no-clear-XY         Do not remove objects touching the XY edges of the
                        stack.
  --clear-Z             Remove objects touching the bottom/top of the stack.
  --gaussian GAUSSIAN   Apply a Gaussian low pass filter to the image
  --version             show program's version number and exit

slice arguments:
  --only-focus          Export mask for the most in-focus slice only.
  --most-objects        Export mask only for the slice with most objects.

advanced arguments:
  --dilate-fill-erode NUMBER
                        Number of pixels for dilation/erosion steps in a
                        dilate-fill-erode operation. Default: 0. Set to 0 to
                        skip.
  --TCZYX               Input is TCZYX instead of TZCYX.
  --labeled             Export masks as labeled instead of binary.
  --uncompressed        Generate uncompressed TIFF binary masks.
  --no-rescaling        Do not rescale image even if deconvolved.
  --debug               Log also debugging messages. Silenced by --silent.
  --silent              Limits logs to critical events only.
  --inreg REGEXP        Regular expression to identify input TIFF images.
                        Default: '^.*\.tiff?$'
  --threads NUMBER      Number of threads for parallelization. Default: 1
  -y, --do-all          Do not ask for settings confirmation and proceed.
