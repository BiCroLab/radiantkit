                                    input ref_channel

Generate average radial
        profiles for a cell population. Requires a folder containing tiff
        images with grayscale intensities and masks with segmented nuclei.
        We recommend deconvolving the grayscale images to obtain a better
        reconstruction of the radial profile.

        Crucial aspect and axes

        A radial profile is intended to be a curve with voxel intensity (Y) as
        a function of a distance (X). This distance can either be the distance
        of a voxel from the nuclear lamina, or from the nuclear center. Here,
        the distance from the nuclear lamina is calculated as the euclidean
        distance from the background of masks of segmented nuclei. See below,
        for multiple definitions of nuclear center, accessible via the
        --center-type parameter. The profile is also generated for a normalized
        lamina distance, obtain by dividing the absolute lamina distance of a
        voxel by the sum of absolute lamina and center distances.

        Center definitions:
        - Centroid: ...
        - Center of Mass: ...
        - Quantile: ...
        - Maxima: ...

  --output OUTPUT       Path to folder where output should be written to.
                        Defaults to "objects" subfolder in the input
                        directory.
  --version             show program's version number and exit

critical arguments:
  --aspect Z Y X        Physical size of Z, Y and X voxel sides in nm.

  --quantile NUMBER     Quantile used to identify the center when '--center-
                        type QUANTILE' is used. A number from 0 to 1 is
                        expected. Defaults to 1e-N where N is the number of

  --degree NUMBER       Degree of polynomial fitting. Default: 5.
  --slice2d             Perform measurements only in one lateral plane. The
                        plane where each nuclei has the largest cross section
                        area will be used.

pickle arguments:
  --pickle-name STRING  Filename for input/output pickle file. Default:
                        'radiant.pkl'
  --export-instance     Export pickled series instance.
  --import-instance     Unpickle instance if pickle file is found.

advanced arguments:
  --block-side NUMBER   Structural element side for dilation-based background/
                        foreground measurement. Should be odd. Default: 11.

  --uncompressed        Generate uncompressed TIFF binary masks.
  --inreg REGEXP        Regular expression to identify input TIFF images. Must
                        contain 'channel_name' and 'series_id' fields.
                        Default: '^(?P<dw_flag>dw_)?([^\.]*\.)?(?P<channel_nam
                        e>[^/]*)_(?P<series_id>[0-
                        9]+)(?P<ext>(_cmle)?(\.[^\.]*)?\.tiff?)$'
  --threads NUMBER      Number of threads for parallelization. Default: 1
  -y, --do-all          Do not ask for settings confirmation and proceed.
