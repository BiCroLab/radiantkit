                                input ref_channel

Select nuclei (objects) from segmented images based on their size (volume in
3D, area in 2D) and integral of intensity from raw image.

To achieve this, the script looks for mask/raw image pairs in the input folder.
Mask images are identified by the specified prefix/suffix. For example, a pair
with suffix "mask" would be:
    [RAW] "dapi_001.tiff" and [MASK] "dapi_001.mask.tiff".

Nuclei are extracted and size and integral of intensity are calculated. Then,
their density profile is calculated across all images. A sum of Gaussian is fit
to the profiles and a range of +-k_sigma around the peak of the first Gaussian
is selected. If the fit fails, a single Gaussian is fitted and the range is
selected in the same manner around its peak. If this fit fails, the selected
range corresponds to the FWHM range around the first peak of the profiles. In
the last scenario, k_sigma is ignored.

A tabulation-separated table is generated with the nuclear features and whether
they pass the filter(s). Alongside it, an html report is generated with
interactive data visualization.

positional arguments:
  input                 Path to folder containing deconvolved tiff images and
                        masks.
  ref_channel           Name of channel with DNA staining intensity.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit

critical arguments:
  --k-sigma NUMBER      Suffix for output binarized images name. Default: 2.5
  --mask-prefix TEXT    Prefix for output binarized images name. Default: ''.
  --mask-suffix TEXT    Suffix for output binarized images name. Default:
                        'mask'.

pickle arguments:
  --pickle-name STRING  Filename for input/output pickle file. Default:
                        'radiant.pkl'
  --export-instance     Export pickled images instance.
  --import-instance     Unpickle instance if pickle file is found.

advanced arguments:
  --block-side NUMBER   Structural element side for dilation-based background/
                        foreground measurement. Should be odd. Default: 11.
  --use-labels          Use labels from masks instead of relabeling.
  --no-rescaling        Do not rescale image even if deconvolved.
  --no-remove           Do not export masks after removing discarded nuclei
                        labels.
  --uncompressed        Generate uncompressed TIFF binary masks.
  --inreg REGEXP        Regular expression to identify input TIFF images. Must
                        contain 'channel_name' and 'series_id' fields.
                        Default: '^(?P<dw_flag>dw_)?([^\.]*\.)?(?P<channel_nam
                        e>[^/]*)_(?P<series_id>[0-
                        9]+)(?P<ext>(_cmle)?(\.[^\.]*)?\.tiff?)$'
  --threads NUMBER      Number of threads for parallelization. Default: 1
  -y, --do-all          Do not ask for settings confirmation and proceed.
